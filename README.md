# Vibe Coding Template

## Prerequisites

Before running any automation against this repo, ensure your Agentic AI can read and comply with `AGENTS.md`.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create `docs/PLAN.md` to capture backlog priorities, sequencing, and ownership for upcoming work.
- [ ] Update `docs/DESIGN.md` with design tokens, layout references, and inspiration assets so future features share the same visual language.
- [ ] Swap the default font stack for something original to avoid the "vibe coded" look and document the change inside `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- [ ] Update the `name` field in `package.json` along with site metadata (title, description, Open Graph) to reflect the projectâ€™s identity.
- [ ] After implementation, use `pnpm knip` to identify all unused files and packages, and strip down the project repository.
