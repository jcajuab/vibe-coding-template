# Vibe Coding Template

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create `docs/DESIGN.md` with design tokens, layout references, and inspiration assets so future features share the same visual language.
- [ ] Create `docs/PLAN.md` to capture backlog priorities, sequencing, and ownership for upcoming work.
- [ ] Swap the default font stack for something original to avoid the "vibe coded" look and document the change inside `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- [ ] Update the `name` field in `package.json` along with site metadata (title, description, Open Graph) to reflect the projectâ€™s identity.
- [ ] Collect reference imagery that informs your design tokens and include those sources or swatches in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
